I am a software engineer from Northwest Indiana. I have 7+ years of development experience. I was the main developer at GrammaCards and took care of all of the software design and architecture as well as all of the programming. I also worked at Affordable Solutions, LLC as a partner doing basic technology support and writing basic scripts to automate required tasks. Some of my professional interests include programming for fun, learning more about Linux and automating things
