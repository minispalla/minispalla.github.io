I am a software engineering contractor from northwest Indiana. I have more than 7 years of experience in Android but would like to continue to expand my programming knowledge. One of my favorite projects was GrammaCards. Not only did I design the software, but also the architecture and programming. My personal interests include programming for fun,  automation, Linux and learning more about computer security.
